<h1>Overview</h1>
The purpose of this game is to replicate near-perfect feline bahaviors from an AI program. Based on a few genetically-proven 
behavioaral variables, the AI will interpret additional data about the cats environment, current stimulations, and past
learning to opperate a feline model in emulation of a real cat.
<br>The user experience will be to interact with this cat through VR hands and voice commands to pet it, play with it, and 
enjoy watching it as it cats about. If all goes well, the user should e able to welcome the cat onto their lap, and enjoy 
watching the realisticaly-rendered life-like fur move as their VR hand "pets" it. There will also be a purr generator 
program for sound. I do not like looped sounds, as after a while, I can hear the looping and find it to be irritating. Purrs 
will be given a basic set of paramiters and allowed to randomly fluctuate a specific amount within them.
<br>I want as much of this game to be generated by the computer as possible. We can skip over crafting the cat's vocal 
chords and coding a program to calculate the sounds they would make- though I've no doubt, if sucsessful, such a program 
would be swarmed over by biologists and game developers alike. -Perhaps I should just focus on this? Odds are, a similar 
program already exists.
